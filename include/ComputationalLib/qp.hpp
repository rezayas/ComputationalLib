 The quadprog_solve() function implements the algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani 
 for the solution of a (convex) Quadratic Programming problem
 by means of an active-set dual method.
	 
The problem is in the form:

min 0.5 * x G x + g0 x
s.t.
    CE^T x + ce0 = 0
    CI^T x + ci0 >= 0
	 
 The matrix and vectors dimensions are as follows:
     G: n * n
		g0: n
				
		CE: n * p
	 ce0: p
				
	  CI: n * m
   ci0: m

     x: n
 
The function returns true if there is a solution.
If there is, it writes it into x.
NOTE: If x is of the proper size, it is taken as a guess at the solution.

 Notes:
  1. pay attention in setting up the vectors ce0 and ci0. 
	   If the constraints of your problem are specified in the form 
	   A^T x = b and C^T x >= d, then you should set ce0 = -b and ci0 = -d.  
	   2. This takes B (BG = I) and Î¸ (= B g0)
